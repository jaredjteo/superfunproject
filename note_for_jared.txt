Note for Jared

I've attached the command.txt file I was working with

It's almost working with the sleep function, however:
There's a shift_ready_queue(); call within the enqueue_ready_from_sleeping() function
This just immediately deletes what was just put in the ready call - but without this line the code just doesn't work even harder
This is the problem to fix :)

Also, I changed the queue types from processes to just commands
So now there's a few extra pieces of data held in the commands
- p_id
- time_evoked
- some sleeping data
